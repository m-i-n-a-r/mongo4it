# MonGO4it

A case study based on **Rome Open Data** and **MongoDB**, to derive a measure of car **accident risk** on a point or a route for a set of conditions, from a series of enriched data from multiple **additional sources**. Plus some nice **UI** and **charts**. Coded in a hurry in a **2 days** Hackathon!

## Introduction
The idea of this project is to improve the danger awareness and provide a "safer route" when driving in big cities like Rome, which also provide Open Data and live services to assemble a complete and statistically relevant dataset. On top of that, the repository contains a responsive site, made as an example. Another great application of such idea is a mobile app (or a car embedded app).
